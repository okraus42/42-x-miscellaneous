Binary vs Octal vs Hexadecimal (vs Decimal)
- ASCII
- chmod
- RGB(A)

- Use in .c files 0x vs 0
(Max INT, max Unsigned INT = -1 in binary)

Binary is for computers, hexadecimal is for humans (hard to not get lost in the 1's and 0's)
Computers can "remember" lots of simple symbols.
Humans can remember few complex symbols. (about 8 in short term memory)
Hexadecimal works for bytes of 8 bits.

Bitwise
 - & | ^ << >>
 - bitshifts and bitmasks
 - efficient calculations in base 2

Endianness
- least significant/ most significant bit and byte

Memory (printing memory)
- bit vs byte
- heap vs stack
- implicit casting?
